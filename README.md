RESPONSIVE WEBSITE 

Task
In this project, you will build a functional responsive website using HTML5 and CSS. We will provide you with content to use on your website - we want you to focus on the code, not thinking about also having to create content. 

The source content this year will be from Canberra Modern. 


A lo fi wireframe was made at the beginning of this project to give me guidance while coding the site. Eventually this ended up changing and the layout became even more simple, using CSS to style the content accordingly.

(Elements that changed: 
Number of pages (initially it was a one page site). 
Use of image sliders : created gallery grids for images and used CSS flexbox and grid for content. 
Footer: simple footer) 

Once I started coding, I was using flexbox and CSS grid to create containers for the content. This was helpful because I could focus on the layout of the content insert the written content and images once I was satisfied with the layout. The hardest part was trying to figure out how each element would look on different devices and figuing out the best layout.
